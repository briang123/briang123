## üëã Hi, I'm Brian Gaines!

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a collaborative engineering leader who believes teams do their best work when there is trust, clarity, and shared ownership. I give engineers a real voice in how we build things while keeping us aligned on the big picture. My focus is on open communication, unblocking challenges quickly, and making sure people feel supported, especially when priorities shift or pressure builds. I do not micromanage; instead, I stay close enough to help guide technical decisions when needed. My ultimate goal is to build a healthy team culture where engineers feel proud of what they are building and enjoy the process of solving hard problems together.

With over two decades of **full-stack development experience**, I have led globally distributed teams in delivering scalable mobile solutions for some of the world's most recognized retail brands. At Branding Brand, I helped launch white-label mobile commerce platforms using **React Native and Flutter**, drove process innovation, and cultivated a culture of learning and technical excellence. My technical background includes front-end work in **React** and **React Native**, backend systems like **ASP.NET** and **Node.js**, and database development with **SQL Server** and **Oracle**.

Beyond engineering leadership, I‚Äôve been exploring ways to apply AI creatively by building side projects and lightweight SaaS tools. I'm especially interested in how AI can streamline development workflows and create new opportunities for automation, personalization, and problem-solving. I‚Äôm also following the evolution of Web3 and crypto, and enjoy experimenting with apps and protocols in the decentralized space.

Earlier in my career, I served as Race Director for the Christmas in July Races and the Des Plaines River Trail Races, managing sponsorships, marketing, operations, and race-day logistics. That experience gave me firsthand insight into **entrepreneurship**, brand building, and delivering large-scale experiences with tight timelines.

Throughout my career, I have worn many hats, including developer, mentor, team lead, project manager, entrepreneur, and strategic partner to business stakeholders. I am passionate about creating environments where engineers can thrive, products can scale, and teams can innovate together.

## üîç What I'm Seeking

I'm actively seeking my next leadership opportunity. Having built a strong foundation as a Senior Engineer, Team Lead, and IT Project Manager, I am now focused on a management role that leverages my extensive experience with modern tech stacks and leading distributed teams.

My ideal position is one where I can act as a **servant leader**, focusing on the non-coding aspects of engineering management. This includes leading technical direction, participating in daily engineering discussions and code reviews, and most importantly, mentoring and coaching engineers to foster their career growth. I am passionate about creating environments where my team can thrive and consistently deliver successful, high-impact projects.

## üè´ Education

I attended Belleville Area College on a Tennis scholarship in Belleville, IL from 1990 to 1992 to get my general studies out of the way.

I then transferred to Illinois State University in Normal, IL and graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology.

## ‚öíÔ∏è My Move From Geology to Software Development

After graduating with a Geology degree, I obtained a job with an environmental consulting company ([Mostardi-Platt](https://www.mostardiplatt.com/)) as a Testing Technician and Report Writer. My role there involved climbing smokestacks, collecting emissions data, and writing reports that were submitted to the EPA.

While processing data, field workers manually created spreadsheets for each testing session. A colleague introduced me to Excel macros and VBA programming, showing me how to record and automate repetitive tasks. This sparked my interest for coding.

Around 1997, at the height of the .com boom, I became fascinated with how I could use code to make my work more efficient. I started learning programming by recording and modifying macros, which gave me a hands-on introduction to coding.

Seeing the potential, I decided to pursue coding full-time and put my resume on Monster.com. Within a week, I was hired by a consulting company (Bond Technologies) that trained me on the job. I was exposed to a variety of technologies, programming languages, and industries by being placed with different clients. During this time, I became accustomed to learning new technologies regularly and worked with many different stacks, including Classic ASP, VB, VB.NET, Delphi, XML, Vignette StoryServer, and SQL Server.

This approach, learning by doing and being thrown into diverse tech environments became my pathway from geology to a full-time career in software development.

## üéµ Spotify Focus Playlist

I wanted to share a coding playlist I created that is mostly of Post-Rock and Electronic Instrumental music that contains sounds which allow you to forget the world and just focus on coding or any other focus activity. The songs truly are relaxing and will allow you to get in a zone for extended periods of time. Feel free to follow the playlist if you're on Spotify.
